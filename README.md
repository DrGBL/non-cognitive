# Investigating the Genetic Architecture of Non-Cognitive Skills Using GWAS-by-Subtraction 

Code used to create the GWAS-by-subtraction of non-cognitive abilities, and for follow-up analyses. 

1. Meta-analysis of the GWAS of EA from Lee et al. 2018 and from 23andMe
2. GWAS-by-substraction with Genomic SEM 
3. Genetic correlations 
4. Mediation analyses
5. Polygenic score analyses 
6. Transcriptome-wide analysis
7. Bioannotation analyses with MAGMA and stratified LDscore regression
