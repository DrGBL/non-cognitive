# Investigating the Genetic Architecture of Non-Cognitive Skills Using GWAS-by-Subtraction 

Code used to create the GWAS-by-subtraction of non-cognitive abilities, and for follow-up analyses. 

1. Meta-analysis of the GWAS of EA from Lee et al. 2018 and from 23andMe
2. GWAS-by-subtraction with Genomic SEM 
3. Genetic correlations 
4. Polygenic score analyses 
5. Transcriptome-wide analysis
6. Bioannotation analyses with MAGMA and stratified LDscore regression


Code was written with GenomicSEM_0.0.2 

A tutorial to run a GWAS-by-subtraction is also available [here](https://rpubs.com/MichelNivard/565885).
