### Enrichment of tissue specific gene expression.

This directory contains the script used to perfrom tissue partitioned LDSC using annotations that reflect tissue specific gene expresison as described in [Finucane et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0081-4).


This script will run on linux, and with a bit of fidling on a mac, it is based on the more complete tutorial found on the original LDSC github: [click here](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Cell-type-specific-analyses).
