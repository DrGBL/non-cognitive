# Genetics correlations 

Genetic correlations reported in the paper (*Figure 3, 4, Supplementary Figure 11*) are done following the methods/scripts in the folder **With Cog and NonCog summary statistics**.

Decomposition of the correlation (estimate the percentage of the genetic covariance between EA and the target traits that was explained by *Cog and NonCog*) are reported in the folder **Decomposition of the correlation**. 

Sensitivity analyses are reported in the folder **Without using SNP effects**: 
We run additional genetic correlations without using SNP effects, as sensitivity measures.
Additional sensitivity analyses are also reported: "Probing potential biases due to cohort differences in SNP heritability", "Sensitivity test for non-zero correlation of Cog and NonCog", "Sensitivity test for causal relation between CP and EA".
