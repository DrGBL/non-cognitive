Genetics correlations reported in the paper and in Supplementary table X are done 
following the methods in the folder *With Cog and NonCog summary statistics*. \

Scripts to the percentage
of the genetic covariance between educational attainment and the target traits that was explained by 
Cog and NonCog are reported in the folder *Mediation* (see model illustrated in Supplementary Figure 8). \

We run additional genetic correlations wihtout using SNP effects as sensitivity measures. More description, results and scripts 
are available in the folder *Without using SNP effects*.
