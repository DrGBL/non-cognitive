__Genetics correlations reported in the paper are done 
following the methods in the folder *With Cog and NonCog summary statistics*.__

Scripts to the percentage
of the genetic covariance between educational attainment and the target traits that was explained by 
Cog and NonCog are reported in the folder *Decomposition of the correlation* (see model illustrated in Supplementary Figure 8). 

We run additional genetic correlations without using SNP effects, as sensitivity measures. We run these fixing a non-zero correlation between Cog and NonCog as sensitivity measures. More description, results and scripts are available in the folder *Without using SNP effects*.
